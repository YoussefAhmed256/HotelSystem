## Database Schema

The database is built using Microsoft SQL Server and contains several tables to store information related to guests, rooms, bookings, and services.

### Tables:

1. **Guest**: Stores guest details (SSN, name, email, phone).
2. **Floor**: Stores floor information for the hotel.
3. **Room**: Stores room details, including floor, room class, and status.
4. **Booking**: Records booking details, including the guest, check-in/check-out dates, number of rooms, and total amount.
5. **Booking_Room**: Represents the many-to-many relationship between bookings and rooms.
6. **Room_Class**: Contains information about room classes (Standard, Deluxe, Suite) and their prices.
7. **Room_Status**: Defines room statuses (e.g., Available, Occupied, Maintenance).
8. **Services**: Stores services offered by the hotel, such as breakfast, spa, etc.
9. **Booking_Service**: Represents the many-to-many relationship between bookings and services.

### Key Features:

- **Triggers**: Updates room status automatically after a guest checks out.
- **Stored Procedures**: Retrieves available rooms based on check-in and check-out dates.
